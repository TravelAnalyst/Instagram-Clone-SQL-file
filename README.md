# Instagram-Clone-SQL-file
Using MySQL I have created Instagram clone project that involves several tables.
Information of tables created you will find in sql files.
Word document includes analysis performed to answer following questions:

1) We want to reward users who have been around the longest (find the 5 oldest users)
2)What day of the week do most users register on? (To schedule an ad campaign)
3) We would like to target our inactive users with an email campaign (users that did not post any photo)
4) We are running a new contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo (which photo got the most likes)
5) How many times does the average user post?
6) A brand wants to know which hashtags to use in a post?
(what are the top 5 most commonly used hashtags?)
7) We have a small problem with bots on our site..
Find users who liked every single photo on the site
